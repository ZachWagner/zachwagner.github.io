<a href="/etc/CV.pdf" target="_blank">Here's my CV (Updated July 2023)</a>

I'm working with the applied mathematics group at UCSB, under the supervision of Carlos Garcia-Cervera. My general areas of research are:

* Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
* Variational Problems Pertaining to Energy Minimization of Quantum Systems
* Functional Analysis
* Partial Differential Equations
* Numerical Methods in Quantum Mathematics

I'll post publications/preprints here when they become available.

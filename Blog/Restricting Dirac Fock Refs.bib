It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including: a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, and a significantly expanded bibliography."--Publisher's description},

They are used in computational chemistry, and yield results on the inner-shell electrons of heavy atoms that are in very good agreement with experimental data. By a variational method, we prove the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions of the Dirac–Fock equations “without projector”, for Coulomb systems of electrons in atoms, ions or molecules, with Z ≤ 124, N ≤ 41, N ≤ Z. Here, Z is the sum of the nuclear charges in the molecule, N is the number of electrons.},

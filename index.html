        		<h1>Zach Wagner</h1>
				<p>I am a first year mathematics graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  I'm exploring my
  areas of research interest, which are quite diverse at the moment and include topology, analysis, PDEs, and functional analysis.  I imagine
  these will soon converge to a more targeted area of interest in the intersection of the aforementioned fields.</p>

  <p>My office is in South Hall, Room 6431A (in the grad tower).  Please note that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I will not be present 
			in my office until further notice.  I'm available by email and Zoom.  If you would like to make a Zoom 
			appointment with me, please email me.</p>
			
  <p>I'm not teaching during Summer Session A of 2020.  During Summer Session B of 2020, I'll be a TA for Math 6B.  In any case, I'm generally 
			available if you need to contact me (email is the best way to get ahold of me).</p>

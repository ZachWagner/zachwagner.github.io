        		<h1>Zach Wagner</h1>
				<p>I am a first year mathematics graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  I'm exploring my
  areas of research interest, which are quite diverse at the moment and include topology, analysis, PDEs, and functional analysis.  I imagine
  these will soon converge to a more targeted area of interest in the intersection of the aforementioned fields.</p>

  <p>My office is in South Hall, Room 6431A (in the grad tower).  Please note that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I will not be present 
			in my office in Spring 2020.  I'm available by email and Zoom.  My Zoom contact details will be announced when Spring quarter
			starts.</p>
			
	<p>Please see <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/COVID-19-information">UCSB's COVID-19 information page</a> for more details as to how UCSB is managing essential services during the
	pandemic.  Please make an effort to use known, reliable sources of information regarding the pandemic.  Fight disinformation!</p>

  <p>For Spring 2020, I'm a TA for Math 3A.</p>
  <p>During the 2019-2020 academic year, I am taking the Math 201, 220, and 221 sequences.</p>
